= Creating a MicroProfile application

Learn how to use JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P to build a MicroProfile application.

== What you'll learn

MicroProfile is an initiative to optimize Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture.
You will write REST web services with JAX-RS and JSON-P and also use CDI to inject dependencies
and help manage the lifecycle of your application.

You will create an application that provides an `inventory` service, which allows you to retrieve
the information for a particular host or a list of all previously registered hosts.
If the requested host is not in the inventory, the `inventory` service attempts to retrieve
that host's information by calling its `system` service.

For example, to retrieve a list of all hosts in the inventory, enter the following URL:
```
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts
```

The service responds with a JSON message that contains host information for all previously
registered hosts, such as in the following example:

[source, json]
----
{
  "hosts": {
    "localhost": {
      "os.name": "Mac OS X",
      "user.name": "foo"
    },
    "jon-doe": {
      "os.name": "Windows 10",
      "user.name": "bar"
    }
  },
  "total": 2
}
----

To retrieve information about a specific host, call this address:
```
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/<hostname>
```

The service responds with a JSON representation of the system properties that are retrieved
from the `system` service of the specified host. The `system` service is a simple REST service
that returns the system properties of a host. This service is implemented for you.

You will be running both `system` and the `inventory` services locally, on a single server.

// Creating the Inventory Service with JAX-RS
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the Inventory Service with JAX-RS

First, create the JAX-RS service that serves as the `systems` endpoint:

`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java`

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=**;!cdi-scope;!injection;!method-contents;!comment]
----

The `@Path` annotation identifies the URI path template that the resource responds to.

All `@GET` annotated methods do not yet have implemented bodies, which are planned to be written at a later point.

The `getPropertiesForHost` method responds to a `GET` HTTP request and returns the system properties
JSON object for the specified host. You can use the `@PathParam` annotation inside the method
signature to retrieve the hostname as an argument.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=getPropertiesForHost;!method-contents]
----

The `listContents` method also responds to a `GET` request and returns the currently stored
system properties, the contents of the inventory.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=listContents;!method-contents]
----


// =================================================================================================
// Creating the Inventory Manager
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the Inventory Manager

The Inventory Manager is responsible for storing the data about the systems in the inventory and
managing them.

`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java`

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=**;!cdi-scope;!get;!add;!list;!comment]
----

For simplicity, use a `ConcurrentMap` to store the data. Alternatively, you can use
a database or another service to do so.

This class will contain three simple methods: `add`, `get`, and `list`.

The `add` method adds the JSON object that contains the system properties to the inventory.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=add]
----

The `get` method returns a JSON object that contains the system properties for the specified hostname.
Notice the call to `InventoryUtil`. This class contains utility methods that test connections
and access the `system` service. `InventoryUtil` is covered in more detail in a later section.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=get]
----

The `list` method returns a JSON representation of the current contents of the inventory.
For simplicity, `list` returns only the OS name and username of each registered host.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=list]
----


// =================================================================================================
// Using CDI
// =================================================================================================

== Using CDI

CDI is a Java EE specification that makes it simple for developers to use enterprise beans in web
applications. It simplifies dependency and lifecycle management and enables developers to focus on
their code.

=== Injection

To perform a dependency injection, use the `@Inject` annotation .

In the previous section, you created an `InventoryManager` bean. Inject that bean into
the `InventoryResource` class to use what the bean provides without the need for its instantiation.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=header;injection;!cdi-scope]
----

With the injection in place, implement the `@GET` annotated methods:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=getPropertiesForHost]
----

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=listContents]
----

=== Scope

The CDI specification defines multiple scopes. Use the following annotations to define the scopes
that you need for your objects:

* The `@RequestScoped` annotation indicates that a new instance is created for each request.
* The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation indicates that only one instance is created for each application.

Annotate `InventoryResource` with `@ApplicationScoped` because it does not depend on any request-specific state.
In general, annotate all resources with `@ApplicationScoped` unless they need to be created once
every request.

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryResource.java[tags=header]
----

Annotate `InventoryManager` with `@ApplicationScoped` because it, too, does not depend on any request-specifc state.
For example, when you use a real database resource instead of a 'Map', you improve performance because
the container will not re-initialize database resources on each request.

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryManager.java[tags=header]
----

=== Enabling CDI

You can have a `beans.xml` file under the META-INF directory or under the WEB-INF directory
of your web application for CDI scanning. Since CDI 1.1 and Java EE 7, scanning is enabled by default, so
you do not need a `beans.xml` file here. Annotated beans are automatically discovered by default.


// =================================================================================================
// Accessing the System RESTful web service
// =================================================================================================

== Accessing the System RESTful web service

Recall the `InventoryUtil.getProperties(hostname)` call from <<Creating the Inventory Manager>>.
This class is used to access the `system` service from the `inventory` service as a JAX-RS client.

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/util/InventoryUtil.java[tags=**;!comment]
----

The `InventoryUtil` class contains a `getProperties` method that makes an HTTP `GET` request to
the `system` service and returns the retrieved JSON object. The `responseOk` method tests for a valid
connection to the `system` service at the specified host. Together, these methods enable interaction with
the `system` service.


// =================================================================================================
// Creating the JAX-RS application
// =================================================================================================

== Creating the JAX-RS application

Finally, create an application class and identify the base URI where the application serves requests.

Create the following JAX-RS application class: `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryApplication.java`

[source, java, indent = 0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/InventoryApplication.java[tags=**;!comment]
----

You now have your `inventory` service, and your application has a starting point:
`http://localhost:9080/inventory/properties`


// =================================================================================================
// Building the application
// =================================================================================================

include::{common-includes}/mvnbuild.adoc[]


// =================================================================================================
// Starting the application
// =================================================================================================

== Starting the application

To see the new application in action, run the Maven `liberty:start-server` from the `start` directory:

```
cd start
mvn liberty:start-server
```

Once the server is running, you can find both services at the following locations:

* `http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts`
* `http://localhost:9080/system/properties`


// =================================================================================================
// Testing the MicroProfile application
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the MicroProfile application

The application provides a simple inventory management REST service that you can access at the following URLs:

```
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/{hostname}

# Example URL to retrieve or register a system
http://localhost:9080/inventory/hosts/localhost
```

The first URL returns the current contents of the inventory. The second URL returns the system
properties for the specified hostname. The service retrieves these properties from the inventory.
If the inventory does not have an entry for the specified hostname, the service instead calls
the `system` service that runs on the hostname to retrieve system properties. The system properties
that are retrieved from the `system` service are then stored in the inventory and returned.

Once you start the server, you can access the two previous URLs from your browser to manually test the application.
However, you should rely on automated tests because they will trigger a failure if a code change introduces a defect.
JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple environment to test the application.

=== Setting up the tests

Create a test class, `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java`.

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=**;!class-contents;!comment]
----

Mark each test method with the `@Test` annotation.

Use the `@Before` and `@After` annotations to perform setup and teardown tasks for each
of your individual tests.

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=class;!class-contents;setup;!comment]
----

The test code needs some information about the application in order to make requests. The server
port and the application context root are key and are dictated by the server configuration.
To make the information easier to change, specify it in a single place like the Maven pom.xml file
instead of hardcoding it.

[source, xml]
----
<testServerHttpPort>9080</testServerHttpPort>
<testServerHttpsPort>9443</testServerHttpsPort>
----

These Maven properties can then be passed to the Java test program as a series of system properties:

[source, xml]
----
<systemPropertyVariables>
  <liberty.test.port>${testServerHttpPort}</liberty.test.port>
  <running.bluemix>${running.bluemix}</running.bluemix>
  <cf.context.root>${cf.context.root}</cf.context.root>
</systemPropertyVariables>
----

You can then access these properties with the `System.getProperties` method. Use these properties
to create URL representations for each running service:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=urlCreation]
----

You can use the JAX-RS client to make the REST call and convert the payload to and from a JSON-P
representation. To do so, configure the client with the `JsrJsonpProvider` property:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=clientInit]
----

=== Writing the tests

Normally, you cannot control the order of execution for test methods. However, you can place
each test method within a single container method. This method is then annotated with `@Test`.
The following test suite contains four test methods, which run in the order they appear in the suite:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSuite]
----

Create a test called `testEmptyInventory`. This test asserts that the inventory
is empty when the `inventory` service first starts. Use the `Response` object to receive a
response from the target URL. You can then retrieve the returned JSON from this response.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testEmptyInventory]
----

Write a `getResponse` helper method to reuse the same line of code to retrieve a response from a
particular URL. This method helps keep your code neat and organized.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=getResponse]
----

Write another helper called `assertResponse`. This method ensures that the received response code is
valid and returns a status code 200.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=assertResponse]
----

Use the returned `Response` object to retrieve the JSON file:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=jsonobj]
----

Write an assertion to make sure that the `total` field is set to 0, which indicates that the inventory is empty.
Close the response before the method returns.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=assertAndClose]
----

Create a test called `testHostRegistration`. This test asserts that registering the `localhost` system
is successful.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testHostRegistration]
----

Write a helper method called `visitLocalhost`. This method makes a simple `GET` request to the
`system` service at `localhost`, registering the `localhost` system.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=visitLocalhost]
----

Create a test called `testSystemPropertiesMatch`. This test asserts that the currently stored system
properties for `localhost` match the ones returned by the `system` service.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testSystemPropertiesMatch]
----

Write a helper method called `assertProperty`. Use this method to assert that the properties
`os.name` and `user.name` match.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=assertProperty]
----

Finally, create a test called `testUnknownHost`. This test asserts that the `inventory` service
returns an error when you make a registration attempt on an unknown hostname.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/microprofile/EndpointTest.java[tags=testUnknownHost]
----

=== Running the tests

To rebuild and run the tests, navigate to the `start` directory and run the `mvn clean install` command
from the command line.

```
# If the server is still running from previous steps, stop it first
mvn liberty:stop-server

# Then execute
mvn clean install
```

It might take some time before the tests are executed. If the tests pass, you will see the following
output:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
 T E S T S
-------------------------------------------------------
Running it.io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.EndpointTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.668 sec - in it.io.openliberty.guides.microprofile.EndpointTest

Results :

```

== Congratulations! You're done!

Congratulations! You have just built and tested a MicroProfile application with JAX-RS, CDI, JSON-P
and Open Liberty.
